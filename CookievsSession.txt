Cookie variables are used to track user information by the server and they are stored on the user's local machine.
Anytime a new request is sent to that server, information from the cookie variables are sent along in order to identify the user.

Session variables are temporary variables created on both the user end and the server end of an application.
They are available to all pages of the application during that session. They are used for tracking identity information as well. 
However, at the end of a session, they are always deleted and not stored anywhere.
